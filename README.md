# EDA-and-classification-in-astronomy-data
This repository is based on the Astronomy dataset taken from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data release 17(DR17).
We performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and further various ML Algorithms were implemented and we compared the accuracy of all algorithms.
Our goal is to to help astronomers and astrophysicists to identify between stars , quasars and galaxies which will help them in futher research.

The following is the table of contents:
          1. Configuring the environment
          2. Data Preparation
          3. High level Statistics
          4. Univariate Analysis
          5. Multivariate Analysis
          6. ML Algorithms
